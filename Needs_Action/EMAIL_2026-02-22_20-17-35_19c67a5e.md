Claude Opus 4.6 isn’t the only “thinking” model anymore. Google just shipped a major upgrade: Gemini 3 Deep Think — a specialized reasoning mode aimed at real engineering + research work, not vibe-chat. Here’s what stood out 👇 1) This isn’t “+5% better” Deep Think is positioned like a different operating mode: interpret complex datasets model physical systems through code reason through multi-step problems (math/physics/algorithms) generate real artifacts (more on that below) It’s Google saying: “we’re productizing thinking-time compute.” 2) The benchmark spread is… loud On the charts Google shared, Deep Think jumps hard on the kinds of tests that punish shallow pattern-matching: ARC-AGI-2 (abstract reasoning) Humanity’s Last Exam (academic reasoning) Math/Physics/Chemistry Olympiad-style evaluations Codeforces (competitive programming) Whether you love benchmarks or hate them, the shape of the results matters: Deep Think separates from the “regular pro model” by a lot — which usually means it’s doing something structurally different (more search/verification/reasoning budget), not just a small tuning bump. 3) The most important demo: sketch → 3D-printable object This is the part people will underestimate. If the model c
