## Instructions for Claude

Use the `email-responder` skill to:
1. Classify this email (order_query / complaint / refund_request / shipping_query / general)
2. Draft a professional reply
3. Write approval file to `/Pending_Approval/EMAIL_REPLY_*.md`
4. Move this file to `/Done/` after drafting
