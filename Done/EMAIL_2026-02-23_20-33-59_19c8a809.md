I've been an Opus user since day one.

I want the best available model for production code that’s trustworthy and Opus 4.6 has been exactly that.

But then two things happened in last week:

* MiniMax out of Shanghai dropped M2.5. It is open source, fraction of the cost, and benchmarks say it's nearly as good.

* Anthropic released Sonnet 4.6, their own mid-tier model, now closing the gap with Opus fast.

Let me show you what happened. But first, a set of dev tools that caught my attention:


--------------------
## ==**Dev Tools of the Week**==

**1. **_[MyClaw Host](https://myclaw.host/)_

A platform that lets users deploy and run OpenClaw-style AI agents on their own infrastructure. It focuses on giving teams a simple way to host, manage, and scale autonomous AI agents without needing a complex setup.

**2. **_[Terminal Use](https://www.terminaluse.com/)_

A platform from Vercel that lets teams run background AI agents and long-running tasks alongside their apps. It focuses on making it easier to deploy, manage, and scale agent workflows without building custom infrastructure.

**3. **_[Emdash](https://www.emdash.sh/)_

An open-source agentic development environment designed for building and testing AI agents. It provides tools for managing workflows, debugging agent behavior, and running autonomous systems in a structured development setup.
