Do you want to join my online IELTS VIP course and finally achieve the result you need?

We have had a record amount of students achieve the results that will change their life this month, and that means we have a few spaces available for you to join the VIP Academy… but first, let me tell you about this photo.


It's my favourite place to eat in London - Granger & Co. It always has a line stretching outside and you have to wait sometimes up to an hour to get in… But once you do get inside, it’s like heaven!

The service is amazing, there’s loads of space and the food is delicious, easily the best in London and you can stay for as long as you like.

This is very much like IELTS VIP. There is a long waiting list, but it needs to be that way to ensure that the highest standards are maintained and every student inside is treated like a VIP and has everything they need to achieve the highest results possible.

I get emails every single day asking me when the IELTS VIP Academy is opening and when they can get a space. I always tell them I will let them know at the end of the month if there are any spaces remaining.

Usually, we have 0 spaces remaining, but this month is different...

We have had a record amount of students achieve the results they were after extremely quickly this month and that means we have a few spaces available for you to join the VIP Academy.

Are you interested? We have just 17 places available. We have more than 3,000,000 fans on Facebook and another 500,000 people on our mailing list, so these will go VERY QUICKLY.
