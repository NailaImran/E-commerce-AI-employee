## Draft Post

What if your Shopify store never missed a customer message — even at 2 AM?

We built an AI employee that monitors our inbox 24/7, drafts replies within minutes, and flags every high-value order automatically. No outsourcing. No overnight team. Just smart automation with a human always in the loop.

The result? Faster responses, happier customers, and more time to focus on what actually grows the business.

If you run an e-commerce store and feel buried in emails and order ops — let's talk. This is the future of lean retail.

DM me or drop a comment — happy to share how we set it up.
