Langchain recently crossed 200 million monthly Python package downloads, and one-third of the Fortune 500 now uses it.

They also launched Agent Builder, their no-code agent platform.

It started as an 800-line side project by Harrison Chase in October 2022, and now it's the default framework for building AI apps that go beyond a single API call.

--------------------
## ==**Dev Tools of the Week**==

**1. **_[**Unblocked**](https://getunblocked.com/code-review/)_

AI code review that understands your codebase, integrates with GitHub/GitLab, learns from your team's patterns, and catches issues before they hit production.

**2. **_[**Tines**](https://www.tines.com/campaigns/get-started-tldr)_

No-code automation for security and IT workflows. Think Zapier but built for technical teams handling incident response, threat detection, and compliance tasks.

**3. **_[**npmx.dev**](https://npmx.dev)_

Command runner that lets you execute any npm package directly without installation. Run `npx` commands from any package registry instantly.

You can swap between them by changing one line:

2. Draft a professional reply
3. Write approval file to `/Pending_Approval/EMAIL_REPLY_*.md`
4. Move this file to `/Done/` after drafting
