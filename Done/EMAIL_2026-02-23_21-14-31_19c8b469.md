Harvard just asked a wild question: are you part of the demographics your AI thinks in? Harvard researchers tested GPT models against real human psychology from 65 countries and found that AI thinks 70% closer to the U.S. than to most of the world. When mapped against the World Values Survey, GPT’s mindset clustered near the U.S., U.K., Canada, and Western Europe and farthest from countries like Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The study calls this pattern WEIRD thinking: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic. Why this matters: → AI inherits the mindset of its data. → Most of that data comes from Western societies. → Machine reasoning is quietly becoming culturally one-sided. → Intelligence is being defined by geography, not universality. As cultural distance increases, alignment starts to fade. An LLM trained on one worldview can sound out of sync with another, even when it’s technically correct. Harvard’s work shows that language models reflect the histories, biases and value systems of the data they’re raised on. How do we teach machines to think beyond data’s borders if their roots aren’t global? AI discoverability is the new Google ranking.  People often ask me how to prove presence inside ChatGPT and other AI engines. Screenshots are not a strategy. If a client has 5 LLM citations today and 15 in 90 days, that is 3x visibility. But only if you t
