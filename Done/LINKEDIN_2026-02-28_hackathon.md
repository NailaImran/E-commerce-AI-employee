## Draft Post

What if your e-commerce store could run itself — emails, orders, invoices, and social media — while you slept?

I built exactly that for **Hackathon 0** by **Panaversity** (Personal AI Employee Challenge 2026) — and it's fully live.

Here's what the AI Employee handles autonomously:

📥 **Customer Support** — Reads Gmail, filters spam, classifies emails, drafts professional replies, and waits for my approval before sending. Zero missed messages.

📦 **Order Management** — Watches for Shopify CSV exports, processes every order, flags high-priority ones, and syncs directly to **Odoo ERP** — creating sale orders and invoices automatically.

📊 **Daily Briefings** — Every evening at 8pm, a structured briefing lands in the vault: revenue, order queue, pending actions, and customer email status.

🔍 **Self-Reflection (Ralph Wiggum Loop)** — At 9pm, the AI reads its own audit logs from the past 7 days, scores itself GREEN / YELLOW / RED, and writes a performance report with recommendations.

📱 **Social Media (HITL)** — Drafts posts for Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn. I approve, it publishes.

💡 **Tech Stack:** Python · Node.js · MCP Servers · Playwright · Meta Graph API · Twitter API v2 · Gmail OAuth · Odoo XML-RPC · Claude Sonnet 4.6

This is what Gold Tier looks like — a real AI employee, not just a chatbot.

Huge thanks to **Panaversity** for pushing developers to build systems that actually work end-to-end.
